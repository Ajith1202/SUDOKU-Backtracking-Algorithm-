# SUDOKU-Backtracking-Algorithm

A simple Sudoku Solver implemented using Backtracking Algorithm . 

Sorry , but this is not a GUI version . You would have to enter all the numbers continuously on a single line(YES, ALL THE 81 NUMBERS!).

If the cell is empty , just enter a zero for that cell .

The solution will be displayed as a matrix.
